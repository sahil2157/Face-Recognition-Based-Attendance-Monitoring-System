#Face Recognition-Based Attendance System 🎥👥

An advanced attendance tracking system that uses facial recognition technology to automate attendance marking. Built with Python, it provides a user-friendly interface to register, recognize, and track attendance seamlessly with high accuracy.

##✨ Features

🔐 Face Registration – Securely register student/employee faces in the database.
📷 Real-Time Recognition – Identify individuals instantly through camera feed.
🕒 Auto Attendance – Marks attendance with timestamp automatically.
📊 Report Generation – Attendance stored in CSV format for easy reporting.
💻 Interactive GUI – Simple Tkinter interface for smooth navigation.
⚡ High Accuracy – Uses OpenCV’s robust face detection and recognition algorithms.
🔄 Integration Ready – Can be connected to existing attendance systems.
🏫 Multi-Purpose – Suitable for schools, colleges, offices, and organizations.

##🛠️ Tech Stack

Python – Core programming language (OOP, flexibility, modularity).
OpenCV – For face detection & recognition (Haar Cascades, LBPH algorithm).
NumPy – Handles numerical computations & array operations for image processing.
CSV – Stores attendance logs & student details in structured format.
Tkinter – Provides GUI for user interaction, attendance marking, and reports.

##🚀 How It Works

Register Face – Capture face data and save it in the dataset.
Train Model – Use LBPH algorithm to train recognition model on saved data.
Recognize & Mark Attendance – System detects faces in real-time and marks attendance in CSV with timestamp.
View Reports – Check attendance records directly from the system interface.
